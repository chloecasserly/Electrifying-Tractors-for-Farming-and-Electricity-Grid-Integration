# Electrifying-Tractors-for-Farming-and-Electricity-Grid-Integration
The team are creating an optimisation that aims to minimise the cost of the implementation of electric tractors on farms that have the ability to implement PV, BESS and the use of electricity arbitrage and FCAS to generate revenue. This repository contains all the versions of code that the team have worked on throughout the project.

To access our code please access directly through "Google Colab" at https://colab.research.google.com/. Open a notebook through GitHub by searching "chloecasserly". Access the final code version named 'tractoroptimisationvfinal'. It can also be accessed through this link - https://colab.research.google.com/github/chloecasserly/Electrifying-Tractors-for-Farming-and-Electricity-Grid-Integration/blob/main/tractoroptimisationvfinal.ipynb

The file named "tractoroptimisationvfinal" is the final optimisation code version. This features a user input that allows for choices of infrastructure (BESS, PV, FCAS) and its size as well as the farmers postcode. All instructions on how to use the code are available within the first cell.
